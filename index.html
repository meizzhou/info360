						<p>Over the last ten weeks, my group has planned, investigated, selected, and developed a prototype to solve the problem that “College students have difficulties keeping up to date with their friends’ schedule”, and our final design is a phone application called ScheduleSync that allows students compare schedule with each other and finds free time for them.</p>

						<p>This book goes through all the steps taken to arrive at the current state of ScheduleSync. It details the development of our design problem and how it involved from a loose idea to a fully functional phone application. It also explains the design rationale and decisions involved in the implementation ScheduleSync. While this was a team effort, it focuses on my individual aspect and contribution to the project.</p>

						<p>Our course assignment was to address a design problem in the context of college students surviving college. Before we started working in groups, we individually brainstormed design problems. My first attempt was 
						 <p class = "quote">It can be hard for college students to find new people and make new friends on campus.<p>
						</p>

						<p>When discussing with teammates and research UW Facebook social events, I quickly realized that from student activity, study session, group work or just dorm meeting, it is actually quite easy for students to meet new people and make friends in college.</p>

						<p>Inspired by the problem I brought up, my teammate Preston came up with a problem that after meeting new people, it could be hard for college students to keep update with each other, and may end up losing contacts.</p>

						<p>As a junior in college, I have lost contacts with some friends that I made in my freshmen year, mainly because that we have different majors and our schedule changes too often. I always feel like it is almost impossible to be able to keep track of all my friends’ schedule. </p>

						<p>I agreed with my teammate’s problem and we did a research online, according to XX, 71% percent of college students that are outside fraternity or sorority reported that they find it really hard to keep a friendship in college. Supported by both personal experience and online research data, <p class = "quote">College students have difficulties keeping up to date with their friends</p>becomes our focus.</p>

						<p>Once a prompt was created, interview could begin in order to get ideas. Since our target audience is college student, I did few interviews with my classmates and roommates. There were three objectives I had in mind:</p>

						<p>1.	Do they have the problem of have difficulties keeping up to date with their friends? (To determine if it is also a problem for them)
						<br>2.	Have they ever tried any way to solve this problem? (To see any possible way to solve this problem for inspiration)<br>3.	What way do they prefer to help them keep up to date with their friends? (Collect user preference for design)</p>

						<p>We decided on using interviews because it is fairly inexpensive, can be administered remotely, and has the flexibility of exploring further details. As a group, we decided that by gathering user information through interviews, we could determine their interests and preferences, also find inspiration from them for our ideas. </p>

						<p>After interviewing my classmates and roommates, I definitely gained new insight about this problem. All of them reported that it is relatively hard to maintain friendships in college than in high school. They have tried to ask their friends out through email, text message, social network, but because of their different schedule and time conflict, they always ended up not making plans and eventually drifted apart. What they want is a quick and easy way to help them reunion with their friends again. </p>

						<p>Interviewing with other college students helped me get ideas rolling. We later started the process of intense idea-brainstorming to explore the problem space. Ideation brings crazy ideas and conservative ideas together, disregarding any restrictions. Allows us to think about something we never thought of. No idea was too wild as we came up with interesting possible solutions that were far out and bizarre.</p>

						<p>We focused on quantity not quality on the first time idea brainstorming so that I could explore and evaluate a wide spread of information and solutions that might be applicable to our audience.</p>
						<p>Initially I though I could only come up with no more than 10 ideas, however, I ended up with 40 ideas for the problem space, In total, out team came up with 160 ideas, This taught me that quantity over quality is a good way of reaching a good idea by having many of them!</p>

				<div class = "intro">
				<p>Base on the conclusion of our case study, we decide to prototype 3 of our best ideas from the ideation process. We decided on making either a website or a phone application because we felt that it would best suite the needs of our audience.</p>
				<div class="row section-content">

				</div>

				<p>In hindsight, creating prototypes was very useful in getting feedback from our target users and for testing our ideas. It was a low-cost move early in the design stage, which allowed us to test different design possibilities and get more information before choosing a design.</p>

						<p> Personally I designed the DawgDaze website, I wanted to recreate a dating website that restricted only to UW students. Later on I invested a lot of time doing research about the existing dating website like match.com, to see if they have anything that could inspire me. I learned that the reason why match.com became a popular website is because:</p>

						<p>1.	It is flexible for all kind of users to use <br>
						2.	It protects user’s privacy and information, allows user to set which information they want to show to the public <br>
						3.	It is a very fast and efficient website for people to look for dates 
						</p>	

						<p>With my low fidelity design of DawgDaze website, I interviewed again with two of my classmates with the DawgDates website. Based on the interview, I found out that our participants were not as interested in being in a romantic relationship. Their reasoning was that they wanted to focus on important things like studying and working, also they don’t really trust dating website and they are concerned with their privacy and safety. Although I put a lot of efforts designing this website, base on the interview, I decided to let my solution go. </p>

				<div >
					<div class = "intro">

						<p>The idea that stood out was one that Kyle came up with, a phone application that helps college students compare schedule with each other. Kyle’s research showed that base on the quarter system of UW, students have different schedule every ten weeks, not to mention that the time for their job, homework, student activity are also constantly changing, it is hard for UW students to keep up to date with each other. </p>

						<p>After discussion, we decided on doing ScheduleSync because it is not only an easy and practical application, but also a fast and efficient tool to help college students to keep up to date with each other.</p>

					<div class = "intro">

						<p>Our final product incorporated all our selected designs. Our goal was to create an mobile application that would allow users to keep track of not only their own schedules, but have access to their friend’s schedule as well. By doing so, we hoped that it would allow students to more easily coordinate meetings and also create social encounters with other students on campus. </p>

						<p>Our design took into account existing tools like MyUW to access class schedules, and our modifications contain useful features for users to keep track of their friends’ schedules. </p>

						<p>Personally I designed the layout of the application. in order to create a familiar and intuitive UI, , I took the phone application of Instalgram and facebook as an example for the design layout . with friends located in the top right corner and setting located in the top left. I also modeled our login page and swipe in menus after Facebook’s UI. </p>
