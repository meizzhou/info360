						<p>Over the last ten weeks, my group has planned, investigated, selected, and developed a prototype to solve the problem that “College students have difficulties keeping up to date with their friends’ schedule”, and our final design is a phone application called ScheduleSync that allows students compare schedule with each other and finds free time for them.</p>

						<p>This book goes through all the steps taken to arrive at the current state of ScheduleSync. It details the development of our design problem and how it involved from a loose idea to a fully functional phone application. It also explains the design rationale and decisions involved in the implementation ScheduleSync. While this was a team effort, it focuses on my individual aspect and contribution to the project.</p>

						<p>Our course assignment was to address a design problem in the context of college students surviving college. Before we started working in groups, we individually brainstormed design problems. My first attempt was 
						 <p class = "quote">It can be hard for college students to find new people and make new friends on campus.<p>
						</p>

						<p>After discussing with teammates and researching UW Facebook social events, I quickly realized that from student activity, study session, group work or just dorm meeting, it is actually quite easy for students to meet new people and make friends in college.</p>

						<p>Inspired by the problem I brought up, my teammate Preston came up with a problem that after meeting new people, it could be hard for college students to maintain their friendship</p>

						<p>As a junior in college, I have lost contacts with some friends that I made in my freshmen year, mainly because that we have different majors and our schedule changes too often.</p>

						<p>I agreed with my teammate’s problem and we did a research online, according to O'Connell's research on "why people lose so many friend during college", 71% percent of college students that are outside fraternity or sorority reported that they find it really hard to keep a friendship in college. Supported by both personal experience and online research data, <p class = "quote">College students have difficulties keeping up to date with their friends</p>becomes our focus.</p>

						<p>Once a prompt was created, interview could begin in order to get ideas. Since our target audience is college student, I did few interviews with my classmates and roommates. There were three objectives I had in mind:</p>

						<div class = "question">
						<p>1.	Do they find it hard to maintain a friendship in college? (To determine if it is also a problem for them)
						<br>2.	Have they ever tried any way to solve this problem? (To see any possible way to solve this problem for inspiration)<br>3.	What way do they prefer to help them keep up to date with their friends? (Collect user preference for design)</p></div>

						<p>We decided on using interviews because it is fairly inexpensive, can be administered remotely, and has the flexibility of exploring further details. As a group, we decided that by gathering user information through interviews, we could determine their interests and preferences, also find inspiration from them for our ideas. </p>

						<p>After interviewing my classmates and roommates, I definitely gained new insight about this problem. All of them reported that it is relatively hard to maintain friendships in college than in high school. They have tried to ask their friends out through email, text message, social network, but because of their different schedule and time conflict, they always ended up not making plans and eventually drifted apart. What they want is a quick and easy way to help them reunion with their friends again. </p>

						<p>Interviewing with other college students helped me get ideas rolling. We later started the process of intense idea-brainstorming to explore the problem space. Ideation brings crazy ideas and conservative ideas together, disregarding any restrictions. Allows us to think about something we never thought of. No idea was too wild as we came up with interesting possible solutions that were far out and bizarre.</p>

						<p>We focused on quantity not quality on the first time idea brainstorming so that I could explore and evaluate a wide spread of information and solutions that might be applicable to our audience.</p>
						<p>Initially I though I could only come up with no more than 10 ideas, however, I ended up with 40 ideas for the problem space, In total, out team came up with 160 ideas, This taught me that quantity over quality is a good way of reaching a good idea by having many of them!</p>

				<p>Base on the conclusion of our case study, we decide to prototype 3 of our best ideas from the ideation process. We decided on making either a website or a phone application because we felt that it would best suite the needs of our audience.</p>

				<p>In hindsight, creating prototypes was very useful in getting feedback from our target users and for testing our ideas. It was a low-cost move early in the design stage, which allowed us to test different design possibilities and get more information before choosing a design.</p>

						<p> I individually designed the DawgDaze website, I wanted to recreate a dating website that restricted only to UW students. Later on I invested a lot of time doing research about the existing dating website like match.com, to see if they have anything that could inspire me. I learned that the reason why match.com became a popular website is because:</p>

						<p>1.	It is flexible for all kind of users to use <br>
						2.	It protects user’s privacy and information, allows user to set which information they want to show to the public <br>
						3.	It is a very fast and efficient website for people to look for dates 
						</p>	

						<p>With my low fidelity design of DawgDaze website, I interviewed again with two of my classmates with the DawgDates website. Based on the interview, I found out that our participants were not as interested in being in a romantic relationship. Their reasoning was that they wanted to focus on important things like studying and working, also they don’t really trust dating website and they are concerned with their privacy and safety. Although I put a lot of efforts designing this website, base on the interview, I decided to let my solution go. </p>

						<p>Even though my idea was not selected, designing DawgDaze website still inspired me and influenced our decision on our final solution. The conclusion I made from learning from match.com became our standard for refining our prototype.  </p>

						<h2 class="section-title">2.Combining two designs?</h2>

				<div >
					<div class = "intro">

						<p>ScheduleSync and CampusTracker both address the original problem of staying in touch with friends on campus. ScheduleSync allows students to determine when friends would be free to meet up and CampusTracker allows students to easily find their friends on campus. We thought these two primary features would be highly useful allowing users to socialize more easily and thought both could be implemented into one design. Soon we combined the two application and named it husky union.</p>

				</div>

				<div >
					<div class = "intro">

						<p>However through later user tests with our classmates, we found out that the combination of two designs was not very integrated and that the app seemed to be fragmented into two parts. Users have also reported that the combination of two features confused them when navigating. Our original purpose was to make an easy and efficient application to help people connecting with each other. Obviously this combination does not meet our design standard. Furthermore, some informants reported that they think campus tracker is a little bit creepy, they don’t really want other people to always be able to track where they are in campus. So we decided to drop the CampusTracker feature and mainly focus on ScheduleSync. </p>

						<p>Although we all agreed on doing ScheduleSync and we are very happy about the result, it was not easy to let go two of our good designs. From this experience I learned that design is not a straight path, it always needs options to compare to.
						User test is also a good way to help designer identify any usability problems and make the product more human centered.

						<p>Our final product incorporated all our selected designs. Our goal was to create an mobile application that would allow users to keep track of not only their own schedules, but have access to their friend’s schedule as well. By doing so, we hoped that it would allow students to more easily coordinate meetings and also create social encounters with other students on campus. </p>

						<p>Our design took into account existing tools like MyUW to access class schedules, and our modifications contain useful features for users to keep track of their friends’ schedules. </p>

						<p>Personally I designed the layout of the application. in order to create a familiar and intuitive UI, I took the phone application of Instalgram and facebook as an example for the design layout . with friends located in the top right corner and setting located in the top left. I also modeled our login page and swipe in menus after Facebook’s UI. </p>

					<div class = "intro">

						<p>The most difficult aspect of designing my project is to apply my idea and low fidelity prototype to a practical and useful application. In the beginning of my design process, I had our idea in my head and had the rough prototype drawn on paper, everything went well until I tried to transfer my prototype to a real phone application. There were a lot of details that I need to take care of. For a fully functional phone application, I need to make everything displayed smoothly so user won’t be confused when they use the application for the first time. In the end, by adopting the good feature of popular phone applications like facebook or instalgram, I successfully designed our final version of ScheduleSync with easy navigating system and simple layout.</p>

						<p>Through the design process, we were able to brainstorm a design problem, generate a very large amount of ideas, choose the most robust solutions and filter out the bad ones, then finally conduct user tests and design our solution. At the end of our design process, my group was also confident that our design was relevant and useful in a real world situation, which made the entire process a very rewarding experience.
						</p>

						<p>If I had to do this project again, there are some things I would do differently. I would have assigned each person our team to a specific job. It could be either a project manager, designer or engineer. Functional teams are crucial in order to complete a group project efficiently and effectively. Through ten weeks of working with my teammates, we have establish strong team spirit. However, sometimes I don’t really know what kind of job should I do and ended up doing the same things as my teammate. Overall, I was very happy with our design and very glad that I could work with my teammates.  </p>
